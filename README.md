# Stankin_lab2025
▌Project Overview

This project, developed as part of Stankin_lab2025, provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a CNC machine and visualizing its operational data. It aims to simplify the interaction with CNC machines and enhance understanding of their performance.

▌Key Features

•  CNC Machine Selection: A clear and intuitive interface to choose from available CNC machines.
•  Data Visualization: Utilizes visual elements to present operational data in an easily understandable format (Used MVVM-pattern as part of task).
•  Modern UI: Designed with a focus on usability and a clean, modern aesthetic.

▌Technologies Used

This project leverages a combination of technologies to achieve its goals:

•  Backend:
  •  MySQL: For storing CNC machine data, operational logs, and other relevant information.
  •  C#: For backend logic, data processing, and communication with the MySQL database.

•  Frontend:
  •  XAML: Used for building the user interface, specifically in a WPF application (Windows Presentation Foundation).
  •  CSS: For styling the XAML-based interface and ensuring a consistent visual experience.
  •  JavaScript (JS): For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the user interface (e.g., data updates, event handling).
